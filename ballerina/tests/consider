array size wenas, oter, inner, both
AA -> QQ
unions -. inp and output
empty csv, csv with only headers
null values in both data and headers
table
record {
    int|string
} kind of tests

int can be unsigned32 as well, in that case in the java siode we need to check, isNumber and is not Decimal
skip data rows and datarow count large small equal default scenarios

startNumber > dataStartNumber
skip columns query, nested queries
target ttype should be compatible if the skip is happen or not


LESS TESTS FOR UNIONS AND NULLABLE< CHECK THE ERROR MESSAGES IN V1.

A CSV header that not in record and vice versa
Add tests by changing the type, string to int int to string like that

map record field with default values (match fields with default )


without defining types.

need a combination for mix types. string field to int. boolean field for null like that

missing field error message, field is random

unsigned 32
